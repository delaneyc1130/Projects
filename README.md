# Pseudo-Shell-Project 
This project implements a pseudo-shell that is capable of executing Unix-like system commands in two different modes which are interactive mode and file mode. 
In the basic functionalities of the pseudo-shell, the input commands have the format consisting of an acceptable command and the input parameters if applicable. 
Along with this, error handling of these input commands is needed in order to maintain correct parameters and syntax. 
The Unix-like system commands being implemented are: ls, pwd, mkdir, cd, cp, mv, rm, and cat.
